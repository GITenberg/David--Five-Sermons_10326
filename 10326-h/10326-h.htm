<h1>DAVID: FIVE SERMONS</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>NOTE:&mdash;The first four of these Sermons were preached before
the University of Cambridge.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON I.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S WEAKNESS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Psalm lxxviii. 71, 72, 73.&nbsp; He chose David his servant, and
took him away from the sheep-folds.&nbsp; As he was following the ewes
great with young ones, he took him; that he might feed Jacob his people,
and Israel his inheritance.&nbsp; So he fed them with a faithful and
true heart, and ruled them prudently with all his power.</p>
<p>I am about to preach to you four sermons on the character of David.&nbsp;
His history, I take for granted, you all know.</p>
<p>I look on David as an all but ideal king, educated for his office
by an all but ideal training.&nbsp; A shepherd first; a life&mdash;be
it remembered&mdash;full of danger in those times and lands; then captain
of a band of outlaws; and lastly a king, gradually and with difficulty
fighting his way to a secure throne.</p>
<p>This was his course.&nbsp; But the most important stage of it was
probably the first.&nbsp; Among the dumb animals he learnt experience
which he afterwards put into practice among human beings.&nbsp; The
shepherd of the sheep became the shepherd of men.&nbsp; He who had slain
the lion and the bear became the champion of his native land.&nbsp;
He who followed the ewes great with young, fed God&rsquo;s oppressed
and weary people with a faithful and true heart, till he raised them
into a great and strong nation.&nbsp; So both sides of the true kingly
character, the masculine and the feminine, are brought out in David.&nbsp;
For the greedy and tyrannous, he has indignant defiance: for the weak
and helpless, patient tenderness.</p>
<p>My motives for choosing this subject I will explain in a very few
words.</p>
<p>We have heard much of late about &lsquo;Muscular Christianity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A clever expression, spoken in jest by I know not whom, has been bandied
about the world, and supposed by many to represent some new ideal of
the Christian character.</p>
<p>For myself, I do not understand what it means.&nbsp; It may mean
one of two things.&nbsp; If it mean the first, it is a term somewhat
unnecessary, if not somewhat irreverent.&nbsp; If it mean the second,
it means something untrue and immoral.</p>
<p>Its first and better meaning may be simply a healthy and manful Christianity,
one which does not exalt the feminine virtues to the exclusion of the
masculine.</p>
<p>That certain forms of Christianity have committed this last fault
cannot be doubted.&nbsp; The tendency of Christianity, during the patristic
and the Middle Ages, was certainly in that direction.&nbsp; Christians
were persecuted and defenceless, and they betook themselves to the only
virtues which they had the opportunity of practising&mdash;gentleness,
patience, resignation, self-sacrifice, and self-devotion&mdash;all that
is loveliest in the ideal female character.&nbsp; And God forbid that
that side of the Christian life should ever be undervalued.&nbsp; It
has its own beauty, its own strength too made perfect in weakness; in
prison, in torture, at the fiery stake, on the lonely sick-bed, in long
years of self-devotion and resignation, and in a thousand womanly sacrifices
unknown to man, but written for ever in God&rsquo;s book of life.</p>
<p>But as time went on, and the monastic life, which, whether practised
by man or by woman, is essentially a feminine life, became more and
more exclusively the religious ideal, grave defects began to appear
in what was really too narrow a conception of the human character.</p>
<p>The monks of the Middle Ages, in aiming exclusively at the virtues
of women, generally copied little but their vices.&nbsp; Their unnatural
attempt to be wiser than God, and to unsex themselves, had done little
but disease their mind and heart.&nbsp; They resorted more and more
to those arts which are the weapons of crafty, ambitious, and unprincipled
women.&nbsp; They were too apt to be cunning, false, intriguing.&nbsp;
They were personally cowardly, as their own chronicles declare; querulous,
passionate, prone to unmanly tears; prone, as their writings abundantly
testify, to scold, to use the most virulent language against all who
differed from them; they were, at times, fearfully cruel, as evil women
will be; cruel with that worst cruelty which springs from cowardice.&nbsp;
If I seem to have drawn a harsh picture of them, I can only answer that
their own documents justify abundantly all that I have said.</p>
<p>Gradually, to supply their defects, another ideal arose.&nbsp; The
warriors of the Middle Ages hoped that they might be able to serve God
in the world, even in the battle-field.&nbsp; At least, the world and
the battle-field they would not relinquish, but make the best of them.&nbsp;
And among them arose a new and a very fair ideal of manhood: that of
the &lsquo;gentle, very perfect knight,&rsquo; loyal to his king and
to his God, bound to defend the weak, succour the oppressed, and put
down the wrong-doer; with his lady, or bread-giver, dealing forth bounteously
the goods of this life to all who needed; occupied in the seven works
of mercy, yet living in the world, and in the perfect enjoyment of wedded
and family life.&nbsp; This was the ideal.&nbsp; Of course sinful human
nature fell short of it, and defaced it by absurdities; but I do not
hesitate to say that it was a higher ideal of Christian excellence than
had appeared since the time of the Apostles, putting aside the quite
exceptional ideal of the blessed martyrs.</p>
<p>A higher ideal, I say, was chivalry, with all its shortcomings.&nbsp;
And for this reason: that it asserted the possibility of consecrating
the whole manhood, and not merely a few faculties thereof, to God; and
it thus contained the first germ of that Protestantism which conquered
at the Reformation.</p>
<p>Then was asserted, once for all, on the grounds of nature and reason,
as well as of Holy Scripture, the absolute sanctity of family and national
life, and the correlative idea, namely, the consecration of the whole
of human nature to the service of God, in that station to which God
had called each man.&nbsp; Then the Old Testament, with the honour which
it puts upon family and national life, became precious to man, as it
had never been before; and such a history as David&rsquo;s became, not
as it was with the medi&aelig;val monks, a mere repertory of fanciful
metaphors and allegories, but the solemn example, for good and for evil,
of a man of like passions and like duties with the men of the modern
world.</p>
<p>These great truths, once asserted, could not but conquer; and they
will conquer to the end.&nbsp; All attempts to restore the monastic
and feminine ideal, like that of good Nicholas Ferrar at Little Gidding,
failed.&nbsp; They withered like hot-house exotics in the free, keen,
bracing English air; and in our civil wars, Cavalier and Puritan, in
whatever they differed, never differed in their sound and healthy conviction
that true religion did not crush, but strengthened and consecrated a
valiant and noble manhood.</p>
<p>Now if all that &lsquo;Muscular Christianity&rsquo; means is that,
then the expression is altogether unnecessary; for we have had the thing
for three centuries&mdash;and defective likewise, for it is not a merely
muscular, but a human Christianity which the Bible taught our forefathers,
and which our forefathers have handed down to us.</p>
<p>But there is another meaning sometimes attached to this flippant
expression, &lsquo;Muscular Christianity,&rsquo; which is utterly immoral
and intolerable.&nbsp; There are those who say, and there have been
of late those who have written books to shew, that provided a young
man is sufficiently brave, frank, and gallant, he is more or less absolved
from the common duties of morality and self-restraint.</p>
<p>That physical prowess is a substitute for virtue is certainly no
new doctrine.&nbsp; It is the doctrine of every red man on the American
prairies, of every African chief who ornaments his hut with human skulls.&nbsp;
It was the doctrine of our heathen forefathers, when they came hither
slaying, plundering, burning, tossing babes on their spear-points.&nbsp;
But I am sorry that it should be the doctrine of any one calling himself
a gentleman, much more a Christian.</p>
<p>It is certainly not the doctrine of the Catechism, which bids us
renounce the flesh, and live by the help of God&rsquo;s Spirit a new
life of duty to God and to our neighbour.</p>
<p>It is certainly not the doctrine of the New Testament.&nbsp; Whatsoever
St. Paul meant by bidding his disciples crucify the flesh, with its
affections and lusts, he did not mean thereby that they were to deify
the flesh, as the heathen round them did in their profligate mysteries
and in their gladiatorial exhibitions.</p>
<p>Neither, though the Old Testament may seem to put more value on physical
prowess than does the New Testament, is it the doctrine of the Old Testament,
as I purpose to show you from the life and history of David.</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, can be a substitute for purity and virtue.&nbsp;
Man will always try to find substitutes for it.&nbsp; He will try to
find a substitute in superstition, in forms and ceremonies, in voluntary
humility and worship of angels, in using vain repetitions, and fancying
that he will be heard for his much speaking; he will try to find a substitute
in intellect, and the worship of intellect, and art, and poetry; or
he will try to find it, as in the present case, in the worship of his
own animal powers, which God meant to be his servants and not his masters.&nbsp;
But let no man lay that flattering unction to his soul.&nbsp; The first
and the last business of every human being, whatever his station, party,
creed, capacities, tastes, duties, is morality: Virtue, Virtue, always
Virtue.&nbsp; Nothing that man will ever invent will absolve him from
the universal necessity of being good as God is good, righteous as God
is righteous, and holy as God is holy.</p>
<p>Believe it, young men, believe it.&nbsp; Better would it be for any
one of you to be the stupidest and the ugliest of mortals, to be the
most diseased and abject of cripples, the most silly, nervous incapable
personage who ever was a laughingstock for the boys upon the streets,
if only you lived, according to your powers, the life of the Spirit
of God; than to be as perfectly gifted, as exquisitely organised in
body and mind as David himself, and not to live the life of the Spirit
of God, the life of goodness, which is the only life fit for a human
being wearing the human flesh and soul which Christ took upon him on
earth, and wears for ever in heaven, a Man indeed in the midst of the
throne of God.</p>
<p>And therefore it is, as you will yourselves have perceived already,
that I have chosen to speak to you of David, his character, his history.</p>
<p>It is the character of a man perfectly gifted, exquisitely organised.&nbsp;
He has personal beauty, daring, prowess, and skill in war; he has generosity,
nobleness, faithfulness, chivalry as of a medi&aelig;val and Christian
knight; he is a musician, poet, seemingly an architect likewise; he
is, moreover, a born king; he has a marvellous and most successful power
of attracting, disciplining, ruling his fellow-men.&nbsp; So thoroughly
human a personage is he, that God speaks of him as the man after his
own heart; that our blessed Lord condescends to call himself especially
the Son of David.</p>
<p>For there is in this man (as there is said to be in all great geniuses)
a feminine, as well as a masculine vein; a passionate tenderness; a
keen sensibility; a vast capacity of sympathy, sadness, and suffering,
which makes him truly the type of Christ, the Man of sorrows; which
makes his Psalms to this day the text-book of the afflicted, of tens
of thousands who have not a particle of his beauty, courage, genius;
but yet can feel, in mean hovels and workhouse sick-beds, that the warrior-poet
speaks to their human hearts, and for their human hearts, as none other
can speak, save Christ himself, the Son of David and the Son of man.</p>
<p>A man, I say, of intense sensibilities; and therefore capable, as
is but too notorious, of great crimes, as well as of great virtues.</p>
<p>And when I mention this last fact, I must ask you to pause, and consider
with me very solemnly what it means.</p>
<p>We may pervert, or rather misstate the fact in more than one way,
to our own hurt.&nbsp; We may say cynically, David had his good points
and his bad ones, as all your great saints have.&nbsp; Look at them
closely, and in spite of all their pretensions you will find them no
better than their neighbours.&nbsp; And so we may comfort ourselves,
in our own mediocrity and laziness, by denying the existence of all
greatness and goodness.</p>
<p>Nathan the prophet said that David&rsquo;s conduct would be open
to this very interpretation, and would give great occasion to the enemies
of the Lord to blaspheme.&nbsp; But I trust that none of you wish to
be numbered among the enemies of the Lord.</p>
<p>Again, we may say, sentimentally, that these great weaknesses are
on the whole the necessary concomitants of great strength; that such
highly organised and complex characters must not be judged by the rule
of common respectability; and that it is a more or less fine thing to
be capable at once of great virtues and great vices.</p>
<p>Books which hint, and more than hint this, will suggest themselves
to you at once.&nbsp; I only advise you not to listen to their teaching,
as you will find it lead to very serious consequences, both in this
life and in the life to come.</p>
<p>But if we do say this, or anything like this, we say it on our own
responsibility.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s biographers say nothing of the kind.&nbsp;
David himself says nothing of the kind.&nbsp; He never represents himself
as a compound of strength and weakness.&nbsp; He represents himself
as weakness itself&mdash;as incapacity utter and complete.&nbsp; To
overlook that startling fact is to overlook the very element which has
made David&rsquo;s Psalms the text-book for all human weaknesses, penitences,
sorrows, struggles, aspirations, for nigh three thousand years.</p>
<p>But this subject is too large for me to speak of to-day; and too
deep for me to attempt an explanation till I have turned your thoughts
toward another object, which will explain to you David, and yourselves,
and, it seems to me at times, every problem of humanity.&nbsp; Look
not at David, but at David&rsquo;s greater Son; and consider Christ
upon his Cross.&nbsp; Consider him of whom it is written, &lsquo;Thou
art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because
God hath blessed thee for ever.&nbsp; Gird thee with thy sword upon
thy thigh, O thou most Mighty, according to thy worship and renown.&nbsp;
Good luck have thou with thine honour; ride on, because of the word
of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
thee terrible things.&nbsp; Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people
shall be subdued unto thee, even in the midst among the King&rsquo;s
enemies.&rsquo;&nbsp; Consider him who alone fulfilled these words,
who fulfils them even now eternally in heaven, King over all, God blessed
for ever.&nbsp; And then sit down at the foot of his Cross: however
young, strong, proud, gallant, gifted, ambitious you may be&mdash;sit
down at the foot of Christ&rsquo;s Cross, and look thereon, till you
see what it means, and must mean for ever.&nbsp; See how he nailed to
that Cross, not in empty metaphor but in literal fact, in agonising
soul and body, all of human nature which the world admires&mdash;youth,
grace, valour, power, eloquence, intellect: not because they were evil,
for he possessed them doubtless himself as did none other of the sons
of men&mdash;not, I say, because they were evil, but because they were
worthless and as nothing beside that divine charity which would endure
and conquer for ever, when all the noblest accidents of the body and
the mind had perished, or seemed to perish.&nbsp; In the utmost weakness
and shame of human flesh he would shew forth the strength and glory
of the Divine Spirit; the strength and the glory of duty and obedience;
of patience and forgiveness; of benevolence and self-sacrifice; the
strength and glory of that burning love for human beings which could
stoop from heaven to earth that it might seek and save that which was
lost.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Look at Christ upon his Cross; the sight which melted
the hearts of our fierce forefathers, and turned them from the worship
of Thor and Odin to the worship of &lsquo;The white Christ;&rsquo; and
from the hope of a Valhalla of brute prowess, to the hope of a heaven
of righteousness and love.&nbsp; Look at Christ upon his Cross, and
see there, as they saw, the true prowess, the true valour, the true
chivalry, the true glory, the true manhood, most human when most divine,
which is self-sacrifice and love&mdash;as possible to the weakest, meanest,
simplest, as to the strongest, most gallant, and most wise.</p>
<p>Look upon him, and learn from him, and take his yoke upon you, for
he is meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls;
and in you shall be fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, which he spake,
saying, &lsquo;Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither the
mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his
wealth: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, who exercises loving-kindness, judgment,
and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith
the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON II.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S STRENGTH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Psalm xxvii.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The Lord is my light, and my salvation;
whom then shall I fear?&nbsp; The Lord is the strength of my life; of
whom then shall I be afraid?</p>
<p>I said, last Sunday, that the key-note of David&rsquo;s character
was not the assertion of his own strength, but the confession of his
own weakness.&nbsp; And I say it again.</p>
<p>But it is plain that David had strength, and of no common order;
that he was an eminently powerful, able, and successful man.&nbsp; From
whence then came that strength?&nbsp; He says, from God.&nbsp; He says,
throughout his life, as emphatically as did St. Paul after him, that
God&rsquo;s strength was made perfect in his weakness.</p>
<p>God is his deliverer, his guide, his teacher, his inspirer.&nbsp;
The Lord is his strength, who teaches his hands to war, and his fingers
to fight; his hope and his fortress, his castle and deliverer, his defence,
in whom he trusts; who subdueth the people that is under him.</p>
<p>To God he ascribes, not only his success in life, but his physical
prowess.&nbsp; By God&rsquo;s help he slays the lion and the bear.&nbsp;
By God&rsquo;s help he has nerve to kill the Philistine giant.&nbsp;
By God&rsquo;s help he is so strong that his arms can break even a bow
of steel.&nbsp; It is God who makes his feet like hart&rsquo;s feet,
and enables him to leap over the walls of the mountain fortresses.</p>
<p>And we must pause ere we call such utterances mere Eastern metaphor.&nbsp;
It is far more probable that they were meant as and were literal truths.&nbsp;
David was not likely to have been a man of brute gigantic strength.&nbsp;
So delicate a brain was probably coupled to a delicate body.&nbsp; Such
a nature, at the same time, would be the very one most capable, under
the influence&mdash;call it boldly, inspiration&mdash;of a great and
patriotic cause, of great dangers and great purposes; capable, I say,
at moments, of accesses of almost superhuman energy, which he ascribed,
and most rightly, to the inspiration of God.</p>
<p>But it is not merely as his physical inspirer or protector that he
has faith in God.&nbsp; He has a deeper, a far deeper instinct than
even that; the instinct of a communion, personal, practical, living,
between God, the fount of light and goodness, and his own soul, with
its capacity of darkness as well as light, of evil as well as good.</p>
<p>In one word, David is a man of faith and a man of prayer&mdash;as
God grant all you may be.&nbsp; It is this one fixed idea, that God
could hear him, and that God would help him, which gives unity and coherence
to the wonderful variety of David&rsquo;s Psalms.&nbsp; It is this faith
which gives calm confidence to his views of nature and of man; and enables
him to say, as he looks upon his sheep feeding round him, &lsquo;The
Lord is my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want.&rsquo;&nbsp; Faith
it is which enables him to foresee that though the heathen rage, and
the kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together
against the Lord and his Anointed, yet the righteous cause will surely
prevail, for God is king himself.&nbsp; Faith it is which enables him
to bear up against the general immorality, and while he cries, &lsquo;Help
me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left, for the faithful fail
from among the children of men&rsquo;&mdash;to make answer to himself
in words of noble hope and consolation, &lsquo;Now for the comfortless
troubles&rsquo; sake of the needy, and because of the deep sighing of
the poor, I will up, saith the Lord, and will help every one from him
that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith it is which gives a character, which no other like utterances
have, to those cries of agony&mdash;cries as of a lost child&mdash;which
he utters at times with such noble and truthful simplicity.&nbsp; They
issue, almost every one of them, in a sudden counter-cry of joy as pathetic
as the sorrow which has gone before.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Lord, rebuke me
not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy displeasure.&nbsp;
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones
are vexed.&nbsp; My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long
wilt thou punish me?&nbsp; Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O
save me for thy mercy&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; For in death no man remembereth
thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?&nbsp; I am weary of
my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with my tears.&nbsp;
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine
enemies.&nbsp; Away from me, all ye that work vanity, for the Lord hath
heard the voice of my weeping.&nbsp; The Lord hath heard my petition:
the Lord will receive my prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith it is, in like wise, which gives its peculiar grandeur to that
wonderful 18th Psalm, David&rsquo;s song of triumph; his masterpiece,
and it may be the masterpiece of human poetry, inspired or uninspired,
only approached by the companion-Psalm, the 144th.&nbsp; From whence
comes that cumulative energy, by which it rushes on, even in our translation,
with a force and swiftness which are indeed divine; thought following
thought, image image, verse verse, before the breath of the Spirit of
God, as wave leaps after wave before the gale?&nbsp; What is the element
in that ode, which even now makes it stir the heart like a trumpet?&nbsp;
Surely that which it itself declares in the very first verse:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony
rock, and my defence: my Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will
trust, my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What is it which gives life and reality to the magnificent imagery
of the seventh and following verses?&nbsp; &lsquo;The earth trembled
and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed,
because he was wroth.&nbsp; There went a smoke out in his presence:
and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at
it.&nbsp; He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark
under his feet.&nbsp; He rode upon the cherubims, and did fly: he came
flying upon the wings of the wind.&nbsp; He made darkness his secret
place: his pavilion round about him with dark water, and thick clouds
to cover him.&nbsp; At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed:
hailstones, and coals of fire.&nbsp; The Lord also thundered out of
heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones, and coals of fire.&nbsp;
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings,
and destroyed them.&nbsp; The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations
of the round world were discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting
of the breath of thy displeasure.&nbsp; He shall send down from on high
to fetch me: and shall take me out of many waters.&rsquo;&nbsp; What
protects such words from the imputation of mere Eastern exaggeration?&nbsp;
The firm conviction that God is the deliverer, not only of David, but
of all who trust in God; that the whole majesty of God, and all the
powers of nature, are arrayed on the side of the good and of the oppressed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according
to the cleanness of my hands shall he recompense me.&nbsp; Because I
have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.&nbsp; For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not
cast out his commandments from me.&nbsp; I was also uncorrupt before
him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.&nbsp; Therefore shall the Lord
reward me after my righteous dealing: and according unto the cleanness
of my hands in his eyesight.&nbsp; With the holy thou shalt be holy:
and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faith, again, it is, to turn from David&rsquo;s highest to his lowest
phase&mdash;faith in God it is which has made that 51st Psalm the model
of all true penitence for evermore.&nbsp; Faith in God, in the spite
of his full consciousness that God is about to punish him bitterly for
the rest of his life.&nbsp; Faith it is which gives to that Psalm its
peculiarly simple, deliberate, manly tone; free from all exaggerated
self-accusations, all cowardly cries of terror.&nbsp; He is crushed
down, it is true.&nbsp; The tone of his words shews us that throughout.&nbsp;
But crushed by what?&nbsp; By the discovery that he has offended God?&nbsp;
Not in the least.&nbsp; For the sake of your own souls, as well as for
that of honest critical understanding of the Scriptures, do not foist
that meaning into David&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; He never says that he had
offended God.&nbsp; Had he been a medi&aelig;val monk, had he been an
average superstitious man of any creed or time, he would have said so,
and cried, I have offended God; he is offended and angry with me, how
shall I avert his wrath?</p>
<p>Not so.&nbsp; David has discovered not an angry, but a forgiving
God; a God of love and goodness, who desires to make his creatures good.&nbsp;
Penitential prayers in all ages have too often wanted faith in God,
and therefore have been too often prayers to avert punishment.&nbsp;
This, this&mdash;the model of all truly penitent prayers&mdash;is that
of a man who is to be punished, and is content to take his punishment,
knowing that he deserves it, and far more beside.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Because, as always, David has faith in God.&nbsp; God is a good and
just being, and he trusts him accordingly; and that very discovery of
the goodness, not the sternness of God, is the bitterest pang, the deepest
shame to David&rsquo;s spirit.&nbsp; Therefore he can face without despair
the discovery of a more deep, radical inbred evil in himself than he
ever expected before.&nbsp; &lsquo;Behold, I was shapen in wickedness:
and in sin hath my mother conceived me;&rsquo; because he could say
also, &lsquo;Thou requirest truth in the inward parts; and shalt make
me to understand wisdom secretly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He can cry to God, out
of the depths of his foulness, &lsquo;Make me a clean heart, O God:
and renew a right spirit within me.&nbsp; Cast me not away from thy
presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.&nbsp; O give me the
comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.&nbsp;
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted
unto thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; He can cry thus, because he has discovered that
the will of God is not to hate, not to torture, not to cast away from
his presence, but to restore his creatures to goodness, that he may
thereby restore them to usefulness.&nbsp; David has discovered that
God demands no sacrifice, much less self-torturing penance.&nbsp; What
he demands is the heart.&nbsp; The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit.&nbsp;
A broken and a contrite heart he will not despise.&nbsp; It is such
utterances as these which have given, for now many hundred years, their
priceless value to the little book of Psalms ascribed to the shepherd
outlaw of the Jud&aelig;an hills.&nbsp; It is such utterances as these
which have sent the sound of his name into all lands, and his words
throughout all the world.&nbsp; Every form of human sorrow, doubt, struggle,
error, sin; the nun agonising in the cloister; the settler struggling
for his life in Transatlantic forests; the pauper shivering over the
embers in his hovel, and waiting for kind death; the man of business
striving to keep his honour pure amid the temptations of commerce; the
prodigal son starving in the far country, and recollecting the words
which he learnt long ago at his mother&rsquo;s knee; the peasant boy
trudging a-field in the chill dawn, and remembering that the Lord is
his shepherd, therefore he will not want&mdash;all shapes of humanity
have found, and will find to the end of time, a word said to their inmost
hearts, and more, a word said for those hearts to the living God of
heaven, by the vast humanity of David, the man after God&rsquo;s own
heart; the most thoroughly human figure, as it seems to me, which had
appeared upon the earth before the coming of that perfect Son of man,
who is over all, God blessed for ever.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>It may be said, David&rsquo;s belief is no more than the common belief
of fanatics.&nbsp; They have in all ages fancied themselves under the
special protection of Deity, the object of special communications from
above.</p>
<p>Doubtless they have; and evil conclusions have they drawn therefrom,
in every age.&nbsp; But the existence of a counterfeit is no argument
against the existence of the reality; rather it is an argument for the
existence of the reality.&nbsp; In this case it is impossible to conceive
how the idea of communion with an unseen being ever entered the human
mind at all, unless it had been put there originally by fact and experience.&nbsp;
Man would never have even dreamed of a living God, had not that living
God been a reality, who did not leave the creature to find his Creator,
but stooped from heaven, at the very beginning of our race, to find
his creature.</p>
<p>And a reality you will surely find it&mdash;that living and practical
communication between your souls, and that Father in heaven who created
them.&nbsp; It will not be real, but morbid, even imaginary, just in
proportion as your souls are tainted with self-conceit, ambition, self-will,
malice, passion, or any wilful vice; especially with the vice of bigotry,
which settles beforehand for God what he shall teach the soul, and in
what manner he shall teach it, and turns a deaf ear to his plainest
lessons if they cannot be made to fit into some favourite formula or
theory.&nbsp; But it will be real, practical, healthy, soul-saving,
in the very deepest sense of that word, just in proportion as your eye
is single and your heart pure; just in proportion as you hunger and
thirst after righteousness, and wish and try simply and humbly to do
your duty in that station to which God has called you, and to learn
joyfully and trustingly anything and everything which God may see fit
to teach you.&nbsp; Then as your day your strength shall be.&nbsp; Then
will the Lord teach you, and inform you with his eye, and guide you
in the way wherein you should go.&nbsp; Then will you obey that appeal
of the Psalmist, &lsquo;Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have
no understanding, whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle,
lest they fall upon thee.&nbsp; Great plagues remain for the ungodly.&nbsp;
But whoso putteth his trust in the Lord, mercy embraceth him on every
side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For understand this well, young men, and settle it in your hearts
as the first condition of human life, yea, of the life of every rational
created being, that a man is justified only by faith; and not only a
man, but angels, archangels, and all possible created spirits, past,
present, and to come.&nbsp; All stand, all are in their right state,
only as long as they are consciously dependent on God the Father of
spirits and his Son Jesus Christ the Lord, in whom they live and move
and have their being.&nbsp; The moment they attempt to assert themselves,
whether their own power, their own genius, their own wisdom, or even
their own virtue, they <i>ipso facto</i> sin, and are justified and
just no longer; because they are trying to take themselves out of their
just and right state of dependence, and to put themselves into an unjust
and wrong state of independence.&nbsp; To assert that anything is their
own, to assert that their virtue is their own, just as much as to assert
that their wisdom, or any other part of their being, is their own, is
to deny the primary fact of their existence&mdash;that in God they live
and move and have that being.&nbsp; And therefore Milton&rsquo;s Satan,
though, over and above all his other grandeurs, he had been adorned
with every virtue, would have been Satan still by the one sin of ingratitude,
just because and just as long as he set up himself, apart from that
God from whom alone comes every good and perfect gift.</p>
<p>Settle it in your hearts, young men, settle it in your hearts&mdash;or
rather pray to God to settle it therein; and if you would love life
and see good days, recollect daily and hourly that the only sane and
safe human life is dependence on God himself, and that&mdash;</p>

<h2>SERMON III.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S ANGER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Psalm cxliii. 11, 12.&nbsp; Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name&rsquo;s
sake: for thy righteousness&rsquo; sake bring my soul out of trouble.&nbsp;
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict
my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>
<p>There are those who would say that I dealt unfairly last Sunday by
the Psalms of David; that in order to prove them inspired, I ignored
an element in them which is plainly uninspired, wrong, and offensive;
namely, the curses which he invokes upon his enemies.&nbsp; I ignored
it, they would say, because it was fatal to my theory! because it proved
David to have the vindictive passions of other Easterns; to be speaking,
not by the inspiration of God, but of his own private likes and dislikes;
to be at least a fanatic who thinks that his cause must needs be God&rsquo;s
cause, and who invokes the lightnings of heaven on all who dare to differ
from him.&nbsp; Others would say that such words were excusable in David,
living under the Old Law; for it was said by them of old time, &lsquo;Thou
shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy:&rsquo; but that our Lord
has formally abrogated that permission; &lsquo;But I say unto you, Love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to those who despitefully
use you and persecute you.&rsquo;&nbsp; How unnecessary, and how wrong
then, they would say, it is of the Church of England to retain these
cursing Psalms in her public worship, and put them into the mouths of
her congregations.&nbsp; Either they are merely painful, as well as
unnecessary to Christians; or if they mean anything, they excuse and
foster the habit too common among religious controversialists of invoking
the wrath of heaven on their opponents.</p>
<p>I argue with neither of the objectors.&nbsp; But the question is
a curious and an important one; and I am bound, I think, to examine
it in a sermon which, like the present, treats of David&rsquo;s chivalry.</p>
<p>What David meant by these curses can be best known from his own actions.&nbsp;
What certain persons have meant by them since is patent enough from
their actions.&nbsp; Medi&aelig;val monks considered but too often the
enemies of their creed, of their ecclesiastical organisation, even of
their particular monastery, to be <i>ipso facto</i> enemies of God;
and applied to them the seeming curses of David&rsquo;s Psalms, with
fearful additions, of which David, to his honour, never dreamed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;May they feel with Dathan and Abiram the damnation of Gehenna,&rsquo;
<a name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285">{285}</a> is a fair
sample of the formul&aelig; which are found in the writings of men who,
while they called themselves the servants of Jesus Christ our Lord,
derived their notions of the next world principally from the sixth book
of Virgil&rsquo;s &AElig;neid.&nbsp; And what they meant by their words
their acts shewed.&nbsp; Whenever they had the power, they were but
too apt to treat their supposed enemies in this life, as they expected
God to treat them in the next.&nbsp; The history of the Inquisition
on the continent, in America, and in the Portuguese Indies&mdash;of
the Marian persecutions in England&mdash;of the Piedmontese massacres
in the 17th century&mdash;are facts never to be forgotten.&nbsp; Their
horrors have been described in too authentic documents; they remain
for ever the most hideous pages in the history of sinful human nature.&nbsp;
Do we find a hint of any similar conduct on the part of David?&nbsp;
If not, it is surely probable that he did not mean by his imprecations
what the medi&aelig;val clergy meant.</p>
<p>Certainly, whatsoever likeness there may have been in language, the
contrast in conduct is most striking.&nbsp; It is a special mark of
David&rsquo;s character, as special as his faith in God, that he never
avenges himself with his own hand.&nbsp; Twice he has Saul in his power:
once in the cave at Engedi, once at the camp at Hachilah, and both times
he refuses nobly to use his opportunity.&nbsp; He is his master, the
Lord&rsquo;s Anointed; and his person is sacred in the eyes of David
his servant&mdash;his knight, as he would have been called in the Middle
Age.&nbsp; The second time David&rsquo;s temptation is a terrible one.&nbsp;
He has softened Saul&rsquo;s wild heart by his courtesy and pathos when
he pleaded with him, after letting him escape from the cave; and he
has sworn to Saul that when he becomes king he will never cut off his
children, or destroy his name out of his father&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;
Yet we find Saul, immediately after, attacking him again out of mere
caprice; and once more falling into his hands.&nbsp; Abishai says&mdash;and
who can wonder?&mdash;&lsquo;Let me smite him with the spear to the
earth this once, and I will not smite a second time.&rsquo;&nbsp; What
wonder?&nbsp; The man is not to be trusted&mdash;truce with him is impossible;
but David still keeps his chivalry, in the true meaning of that word:
&lsquo;Destroy him not, for who can stretch forth his hand against the
Lord&rsquo;s Anointed, and be guiltless?&nbsp; As the Lord liveth, the
Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down
into battle, and perish.&nbsp; But the Lord forbid that I should stretch
forth my hand against the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And if it be argued, that David regarded the person of a king as
legally sacred, there is a case more clear still, in which he abjures
the right of revenge upon a private person.</p>
<p>Nabal, in addition to his ingratitude, has insulted him with the
bitterest insult which could be offered to a free man in a slave-holding
country.&nbsp; He has hinted that David is neither more nor less than
a runaway slave.&nbsp; And David&rsquo;s heart is stirred by a terrible
and evil spirit.&nbsp; He dare not trust his men, even himself, with
his black thoughts.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gird on your swords,&rsquo; is all
that he can say aloud.&nbsp; But he had said in his heart, &lsquo;God
do so and more to the enemies of David, if I leave a man alive by the
morning light of all that pertain to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet at the first words of reason and of wisdom, urged doubtless
by the eloquence of a beautiful and noble woman, but no less by the
Spirit of God speaking through her, as all who call themselves gentlemen
should know already, his right spirit returns to him.&nbsp; The chivalrous
instinct of forgiveness and duty is roused once more; and he cries,
&lsquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to
meet me; and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from shedding
blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is plain then, that David&rsquo;s notion of his duty to his enemies
was very different from that of the monks.&nbsp; But still they are
undeniably imprecations, the imprecations of a man smarting under cruel
injustice; who cannot, and in some cases must not avenge himself, and
who therefore calls on the just God to avenge him.&nbsp; Are we therefore
to say that these utterances of David are uninspired?&nbsp; Not in the
least: we are boldly to say that they are inspired, and by the very
Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of justice and of judgment.</p>
<p>Doubtless there were, in after ages, far higher inspirations.&nbsp;
The Spirit of God was, and is gradually educating mankind, and individuals
among mankind, like David, upward from lower truths to higher ones.&nbsp;
That is the express assertion of our Lord and of his Apostles.&nbsp;
But the higher and later inspiration does not make the lower and earlier
false.&nbsp; It does not even always supersede it altogether.&nbsp;
Each is true; and, for the most part, each must remain, and be respected,
that they may complement each other.</p>
<p>Let us look at this question rationally and reverently, free from
all sentimental and immoral indulgence for sin and wrong.</p>
<p>The first instinct of man is the <i>Lex Talionis</i>.&nbsp; As you
do to me&mdash;says the savage&mdash;so I have a right to do to you.&nbsp;
If you try to kill me or mine, I have a right to kill you in return.&nbsp;
Is this notion uninspired?&nbsp; I should be sorry to say so.&nbsp;
It is surely the first form and the only possible first form of the
sense of justice and retribution.&nbsp; As a man sows so shall he reap.&nbsp;
If a man does wrong he deserves to be punished.&nbsp; No arguments will
drive that great divine law out of the human mind; for God has put it
there.</p>
<p>After that inspiration comes a higher one.&nbsp; The man is taught
to say, I must not punish my enemy if I can avoid it.&nbsp; God must
punish him, either by the law of the land or by his providential judgments.&nbsp;
To this height David rises.&nbsp; In a seemingly lawless age and country,
under the most extreme temptation, he learns to say, &lsquo;Blessed
be God who hath kept me from avenging myself with my own hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But still, it may be said, David calls down God&rsquo;s vengeance
on his enemies.&nbsp; He has not learnt to hate the sin and yet love
the sinner.&nbsp; Doubtless he has not: and it may have been right for
his education, and for the education of the human race through him,
that he did not.&nbsp; It may have been a good thing for him, as a future
king; it may be a good thing for many a man now, to learn the sinfulness
of sin, by feeling its effects in his own person; by writhing under
those miseries of body and soul, which wicked men can, and do inflict
on their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>There are sins which a good man will not pity, but wage internecine
war against them; sins for which he is justified, if God have called
him thereto, to destroy the sinner in his sins.&nbsp; The traitor, the
tyrant, the ravisher, the robber, the extortioner, are not objects of
pity, but of punishment; and it may have been very good for David to
be taught by sharp personal experience, that those who robbed the widow
and put the fatherless to death, like the lawless lords of his time;
those like Saul, who smote the city of the priests for having given
David food&mdash;men and women, children and sucklings, oxen and asses
and sheep, with the edge of the sword; those who, like the nameless
traitor who so often rouses his indignation&mdash;his own familiar friend
who lifted up his heel against him&mdash;sought men&rsquo;s lives under
the guise of friendship: that such, I say, were persons not to be tolerated
upon the face of God&rsquo;s earth.&nbsp; We do not tolerate them now.&nbsp;
We punish them by law.&nbsp; We even destroy them wholesale in war,
without inquiring into their individual guilt or innocence.&nbsp; David
was taught, not by abstract meditation in his study, but by bitter need
and agony, not to tolerate them then.&nbsp; If he could have destroyed
them as we do now, it is not for us to say that he would have been wrong.&nbsp;
And what if he were indignant, and what if he expressed that indignation?&nbsp;
I have yet to discover that indignation against wrong is aught but righteous,
noble, and divine.&nbsp; The flush of rage and scorn which rises, and
ought to rise in every honest heart, when we see a woman or a child
ill-used, a poor man wronged or crushed&mdash;What is that, but the
inspiration of Almighty God?&nbsp; What is that but the likeness of
Christ?&nbsp; Woe to the man who has lost that feeling!&nbsp; Woe to
the man who can stand coolly by, and see wrong done without a shock
or a murmur, or even more, to the very limits of the just laws of this
land.&nbsp; He may think it a fine thing so to do; a proof that he is
an easy, prudent man of the world, and not a meddlesome enthusiast.&nbsp;
But all that it does prove is: That the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit
of justice and judgment, has departed from him.</p>
<p>I say the Spirit of God and the likeness of Christ.&nbsp; Instead
of believing David&rsquo;s own statement of the wrong doings of these
men about him, we may say cynically, and as it seems to me most unfairly,
&lsquo;Of course there were two sides to David&rsquo;s quarrels, as
there are to all such; and of course he took his own side; and considered
himself always in the right, and every one who differed from him in
the wrong;&rsquo; and such a speech will sound sufficiently worldly-wise
to pass for philosophy with some critics; but, unfortunately, he who
says that of David, will be bound in all fairness to say it of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For you must remember that there was a class of sinners in Jud&aelig;a,
to whom our Lord speaks no word of pity or forgiveness: namely, the
very men who were his own personal enemies, who were persecuting him,
and going about to kill him; and that therefore, by any hard words toward
them, he must have laid himself open, just as much as David laid himself
open, to the imputation of personal spite.&nbsp; And yet, what did he
say to the scribes and Pharisees: &lsquo;Ye go about to kill me, and
therefore I am bound to say nothing harsh concerning you&rsquo;?&nbsp;
What he did say was this: &lsquo;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers,
how can ye escape the damnation of hell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes; in the Son of David, as in David&rsquo;s self, there was, and
is, and will be for ever and ever, no weak, and really cruel indulgence;
but a burning fire of indignation against all hypocrisy, tyranny, lust,
cruelty, and every other sin by which men oppress, torment, deceive,
degrade their fellow-men; and still more, still more, remember that,
all young men, their fellow-women.&nbsp; That fire burns for ever&mdash;the
Divine fire of God; the fire not of hatred, but of love to mankind,
which will therefore punish, and if need be, exterminate all who shall
dare to make mankind the worse, whether in body or soul or mind.</p>
<p>But David prays God to kill his enemies.&nbsp; No doubt he does.&nbsp;
Probably they deserved to be killed.&nbsp; He does not ask, you will
always remember, if you be worthy of the name of critical students of
the Bible&mdash;he does not ask, as did the medi&aelig;val monks, that
his enemies should go to endless torments after they died.&nbsp; True
or false, that is a more modern notion&mdash;and if it be applied to
the Psalms, an interpolation&mdash;of which David knew nothing.&nbsp;
He asks simply that the men may die.&nbsp; Probably he knew his own
business best, and the men deserved to die; to be killed either by God
or by man, as do too many in all ages.</p>
<p>If we take the Bible as it stands (and we have no right to do otherwise),
these men were trying to kill David.&nbsp; He could not, and upon a
point of honour, would not kill them himself.&nbsp; But he believed,
and rightly, that God can punish the offender whom man cannot touch,
and that He will, and does punish them.&nbsp; And if he calls on God
to execute justice and judgment upon these men, he only calls on God
to do what God is doing continually on the face of the whole earth.&nbsp;
In fact, God does punish here, in this life.&nbsp; He does not, as false
preachers say, give over this life to impunity, and this world to the
devil, and only resume the reins of moral government and the right of
retribution when men die and go into the next world.&nbsp; Here, in
this life, he punishes sin; slowly, but surely, God punishes.&nbsp;
And if any of you doubt my words, you have only to commit sin, and then
see whether your sin will find you out.</p>
<p>The whole question turns on this, Are we to believe in a living God,
or are we not?&nbsp; If we are not, then David&rsquo;s words are of
course worse than nothing.&nbsp; If we are, I do not see why David was
wrong in calling on God to exercise that moral and providential government
of the world, which is the very note and definition of a living God.</p>
<p>But what right have we to use these words?&nbsp; My friends, if the
Church bids us use these words, she certainly does not bid us act upon
them.&nbsp; She keeps them, I believe most rightly, as a record of a
human experience, which happily seems to us special and extreme, of
which we, in a well-governed Christian land, know nothing, and shall
never know.</p>
<p>Special and extreme?&nbsp; Alas, alas!&nbsp; In too many countries,
in too many ages, it has been the common, the almost universal experience
of the many weak, enslaved, tortured, butchered at the wicked will of
the few strong.</p>
<p>There have been those in tens of thousands, there may be those again
who will have a right to cry to God, &lsquo;Of thy goodness slay mine
enemies, lest they slay, or worse than slay, both me and mine.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There were thousands of English after the Norman Conquest; there were
thousands of Hindoos in Oude before its annexation; there are thousands
of negroes at this moment in their native land of Africa, crushed and
outraged by hereditary tyrants, who had and have a right to appeal to
God, as David appealed to him against the robber lords of Palestine;
a right to cry, &lsquo;Rid us, O God; if thou be a living God, a God
of justice and mercy, rid us not only of these men, but of their children
after them.&nbsp; This tyrant, stained with lust and wine and blood;
this robber chieftain who privily in his lurking dens murders the innocent,
and ravishes the poor when he getteth him into his net; this slave-hunting
king who kills the captives whom he cannot sell; and whose children
after him will inevitably imitate his cruelties and his rapine and treacheries&mdash;deal
with him and his as they deserve.&nbsp; Set an ungodly man to be ruler
over him; that he may find out what we have been enduring from his ungodly
rule.&nbsp; Let his days be few, and another take his office.&nbsp;
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.&nbsp; Let his
children beg their bread out of desolate places.&nbsp; Let there be
no man to pity him or take compassion on his fatherless children&mdash;to
take his part, and breed up a fresh race of tyrants to our misery.&nbsp;
Let the extortioner consume all he hath, and the stranger spoil his
labour&mdash;for what he has is itself taken by extortion, and he has
spoiled the labour of thousands.&nbsp; Let his posterity be destroyed,
and in the next generation his name be clean put out.&nbsp; Let the
wickedness of his father and the sin of his mother be had in remembrance
in the sight of the Lord; that he may root out the memorial of them
from the earth, and enable law and justice, peace and freedom to take
the place of anarchy and tyranny and blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That prayer was answered&mdash;if we are to believe the records of
Norman, not English, monks in England after the Conquest, by the speedy
extinction of the most guilty families among the Norman conquerors.&nbsp;
It is being answered, thank God, in Hindostan at this moment.&nbsp;
It will surely be answered in Africa in God&rsquo;s good time; for the
Lord reigneth, be the nations never so unquiet.&nbsp; And we, if we
will read such words rationally and humanly, remembering the state of
society in which they were written&mdash;a state of society, alas! which
has endured, and still endures over a vast portion of the habitable
globe; where might is right, and there is little or no principle, save
those of lust and greed and revenge&mdash;then instead of wishing such
words out of the Bible, we shall be glad to keep them there, as testimonies
to the moral government of the world by a God and a Christ who will
surely avenge the innocent blood; and as a Gospel of comfort to suffering
millions, when the news reaches them at last, that they may call on
God to deliver them from their tormentors, and that he will hear their
cry, and will help them.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON IV.&nbsp; DAVID&rsquo;S DESERTS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>2 Samuel i. 26.&nbsp; I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful,
passing the love of women.</p>
<p>Passing the love of woman?&nbsp; How can that be, we of these days
shall say.&nbsp; What love can pass that, saving the boundless love
of him who stooped from heaven to earth, that he might die on the Cross
for us?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; David, when he sang those words, knew not the
depth of woman&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; And we shall have a right so to speak.&nbsp;
The indefeasible and Divine right which is bestowed by fact.</p>
<p>As a fact, we do not find among the ancient Jews that exalting and
purifying ideal of the relations between man and woman, which is to
be found, thank God, in these days, in almost every British work of
fiction or fancy.</p>
<p>It is enunciated, remember always, in the oldest Hebrew document.&nbsp;
On the very threshold of the Bible, in the very first chapters of Genesis,
it is enunciated in its most ideal purity and perfection.&nbsp; But
in practice it was never fulfilled.&nbsp; No man seems to have attempted
to fulfil it.&nbsp; Man becomes a polygamist, lower than the very birds
of the air.&nbsp; Abraham, the father of the faithful, has his Sarah,
his princess-wife: but he has others beside, as many as he will.&nbsp;
And so has David in like wise, to the grief and harm of both him and
Abraham.</p>
<p>So, it would seem, had the majority of the Jews till after the Captivity;
and even then the law of divorce seems to have been as indulgent toward
the man as it was unjust and cruel toward the woman.&nbsp; Then our
blessed Lord reasserted the ideal and prim&aelig;val law.&nbsp; He testified
in behalf of woman, the puppet of a tyrant who repudiated her upon the
most frivolous pretext, and declared that in the beginning God made
them male and female; the one husband for the one wife.&nbsp; But his
words fell on unwilling ears.&nbsp; His disciples answered, that if
the case of a man with his wife be such, it is not good for a man to
marry.&nbsp; And such, as a fact, was the general opinion of Christendom
for many centuries.</p>
<p>But of that, as of other sayings of our Lord&rsquo;s, were his own
words fulfilled, that the kingdom of God is as if a man should put seed
into the ground, and sleep and wake, and the seed should spring up,
and bear fruit, he knew not how.</p>
<p>In due course of time, when the Teutonic nations were Christianised,
there sprang up among them an idea of married love, which showed that
our Lord&rsquo;s words had at last fallen on good ground, and were destined
to bear fruit an hundredfold.</p>
<p>Gradually, with many confusions, and sometimes sinful mistakes, there
arose, not in the cloister, not in the study&mdash;not even, alas! in
the churches of God, as they were then; but in the flowery meads of
May; under the forest boughs, where birds sang to their mates; by the
side of the winter hearth; from the lips of wandering minstrels; in
the hearts of young creatures, whom neither the profligacy of worldlings,
nor the prudery of monks, had yet defiled: from them arose a voice,
most human and yet most divine, reasserting once more the lost law of
Eden, and finding in its fulfilment, strength and purity, self-sacrifice
and self-restraint.</p>
<p>That voice grew clearer and more strong as time went on.&nbsp; It
was purged from youthful mistakes and youthful grossnesses; till, at
the Reformation, it could speak clearly, fully, once and for all&mdash;no
longer on the ground of mere nature and private fancy, but on the ground
of Scripture, and reason, and the eternal laws of God; and the highest
ideal of family life became possible to the family and to the nation,
in proportion as they accepted the teaching of the Reformation: and
impossible, alas! in proportion as they still allowed themselves to
be ruled by a priesthood who asserted the truly monstrous dogma, that
the sexes reach each their highest excellence only when parted from
each other.</p>
<p>But these things were hidden from David.&nbsp; One can well conceive
that he, so gifted outwardly and inwardly, must have experienced all
that was then possible of woman&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; In one case, indeed,
he was notably brought under that moral influence of woman, which we
now regard, and rightly, as one of the holiest influences of this life.&nbsp;
The scene is unique in Scripture.&nbsp; It reads like a scene out of
the Middle Age.</p>
<p>Abigail&rsquo;s meeting with David under the covert of the hill;
her turning him from his purpose of wild revenge by graceful compliments,
by the frank, and yet most modest expression of her sympathy and admiration;
and David&rsquo;s chivalrous answer to her chivalrous appeal&mdash;all
that scene, which painters have so often delighted to draw, is a fore-feeling,
a prophecy, as it were, of the Christian chivalry of after ages.&nbsp;
The scene is most human and most divine: and we are not shocked to hear
that after Nabal&rsquo;s death the fair and rich lady joins her fortune
to that of the wild outlaw, and becomes his wife to wander by wood and
wold.</p>
<p>But amid all the simple and sacred beauty of that scene, we cannot
forget, we must not forget that Abigail is but one wife of many; that
there is an element of pure, single, all-absorbing love absent at least
in David&rsquo;s heart, which was present in the hearts of our forefathers
in many a like case, and which they have handed down to us as an heirloom,
as precious as that of our laws and liberties.</p>
<p>And all this was sin unto David; and like all sin, brought with it
its own punishment.&nbsp; I do not mean to judge him: to assign his
exact amount of moral responsibility.&nbsp; Our Lord forbids us positively
to do that to any man; and least of all, to a man who only acted according
to his right, and the fashion of his race and his age.&nbsp; But we
must fix it very clearly in our minds, that sins may be punished in
this life, even though he who commits them is not aware that they are
sins.&nbsp; If you are ignorant that fire burns, your ignorance will
not prevent your hand from suffering if you put it into the fire.&nbsp;
If you are of opinion that two and two make five, and therefore spend
five pounds while you only possess four, your mistake will not prevent
your being in debt.&nbsp; And so with all mortal affairs.</p>
<p>Sin, &alpha;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&iota;&alpha;, means first, it seems
to me, a missing the mark, end, or aim of our existence; a falling short
of the law, the ideal, the good works which God has prepared beforehand
for us to walk in; and every such sin, conscious or unconscious, must
avenge itself by the Divine laws of the universe, whether physical or
spiritual.&nbsp; No miracle is needed; no intervention of God with his
own laws.&nbsp; His laws are far too well made for him to need to break
them a second time, because a sinner has broken them already.&nbsp;
They avenge themselves.&nbsp; And so does polygamy.&nbsp; So it did
in the case of David.&nbsp; It is a breach of the ideal law of human
nature; and he who breaks that law must suffer, as David suffered.</p>
<p>Look at the latter history of David, and at what it might have been.&nbsp;
One can conceive so noble a personage under such woman&rsquo;s influence
as, thank God, is common now, going down into an honoured old age, and
living together with a helpmate worthy of him in godly love and honesty
to his life&rsquo;s end; seeing his children Christianly and virtuously
brought up, to the praise and honour of God.</p>
<p>And what was the fact?</p>
<p>The indulgence of his passions&mdash;seemingly harmless to him at
first&mdash;becomes most harmful ere he dies.&nbsp; He commits a crime,
or rather a complication of crimes, which stains his name for ever among
men.</p>
<p>I do not think that we shall understand that great crime of David&rsquo;s,
if we suppose it, with some theologians, to have been merely a sudden
and solitary fall, from which he recovered by repentance, and became
for the time to come as good a man as he had ever been.&nbsp; Such a
theory, however well it may fit certain theological systems, does not
fit the facts of human life, or, as I hold, the teaching of Scripture.</p>
<p>Such terrible crimes are not committed by men in a right state of
mind.&nbsp; <i>Nemo repente fuit turpissimus</i>.&nbsp; He who commits
adultery, treachery, and murder, must have been long tampering, at least
in heart, with all these.&nbsp; Had not David been playing upon the
edge of sin, into sin he would not have fallen.</p>
<p>He may have been quite unconscious of bad habits of mind; but they
must have been there, growing in secret.&nbsp; The tyrannous self-will,
which is too often developed by long success and command: the unscrupulous
craft, which is too often developed by long adversity, and the necessity
of sustaining oneself in a difficult position&mdash;these must have
been there.&nbsp; But even they would not have led David to do the deed
which he did, had there not been in him likewise that fearful moral
weakness which comes from long indulgence of the passions&mdash;a weakness
which is reckless alike of conscience, of public opinion, and of danger
either to earthly welfare or everlasting salvation.</p>
<p>It has been said, &lsquo;But such a sin is so unlike David&rsquo;s
character.&rsquo;&nbsp; Doubtless it was, on the theory that David was
a character mingled of good and evil.&nbsp; But on David&rsquo;s own
theory, that he was an utterly weak person without the help of God,
the act is perfectly like David.&nbsp; It is David&rsquo;s self.&nbsp;
It is what David would naturally do when he had left hold of God.&nbsp;
Had he left hold of God in the wilderness he would have become a mere
robber-chieftain.&nbsp; He does leave hold of God in his palace on Zion,
and he becomes a mere Eastern despot.</p>
<p>And what of his sons?</p>
<p>The fearful curse of Nathan, that the sword shall never depart from
his house, needs, as usual, no miracle to fulfil it.&nbsp; It fulfils
itself.&nbsp; The tragedies of his sons, of Amnon, of Absalom, are altogether
natural&mdash;to have been foreseen, but not to have been avoided.</p>
<p>The young men have seen their father put no restraint upon his passions.&nbsp;
Why should they put restraint on theirs?&nbsp; How can he command them
when he has not commanded himself?&nbsp; And yet self-restraint is what
they, above all men, need.&nbsp; Upstart princes&mdash;the sons of a
shepherd boy&mdash;intoxicated with honours to which they were not born;
they need the severest discipline; they break out into the most frantic
licence.&nbsp; What is there that they may not do, and dare not do?&nbsp;
Nothing is sacred in their eyes.&nbsp; Luxury, ambition, revenge, vanity,
recklessness of decency, open rebellion, disgrace them in the sight
of all men.&nbsp; And all these vices, remember, are heightened by the
fact that they are not brothers, but rivals; sons of different mothers,
hating each other, plotting against each other; each, probably, urged
on by his own mother, who wishes, poor fool, to set up her son as a
competitor for the throne against all the rest.&nbsp; And so are enacted
in David&rsquo;s house those tragedies which have disgraced, in every
age, the harems of Eastern despots.</p>
<p>But most significant is the fact, that those tragedies complete themselves
by the sin and shame of David&rsquo;s one virtuous and famous son.&nbsp;
Significant truly, that in his old age Solomon the wise should love
strange women, and deserting for their sakes the God of his fathers,
end as an idolater and a dotard, worshipping the abominations of the
heathen, his once world-famous wisdom sunk into utter folly.</p>
<p>But, it may be said, the punishment of David&rsquo;s sin fell on
his sons, and not upon himself.</p>
<p>How so?&nbsp; Can there be a more heavy punishment, a more bitter
pain, than to be punished in and by his children; to see his own evil
example working out their shame and ruin?&nbsp; But do not fancy that
David&rsquo;s own character did not suffer for his sin.&nbsp; The theory
that he became, instantly on his repentance, as good and great a man
as he was before his fall, was convenient enough to certain theologians
of past days; but it is neither warranted by the facts of Scripture,
nor by the noble agonies, however noble, of the 51st Psalm.</p>
<p>It is a prayer for restoration, and that of the only right and true
kind: &lsquo;Take not thy Holy Spirit from me;&rsquo; and, as such,
it was doubtless heard: but it need not have been fulfilled instantly
and at once.&nbsp; It need not have been fulfilled, it may be, till
that life to come, of which David knew so little.&nbsp; It is a fact,
it was not fulfilled in this life.&nbsp; We read henceforth of no noble
and heroical acts of David.&nbsp; From that time forth&mdash;I speak
with all diffidence, and merely as it seems to me&mdash;he is a broken
man.&nbsp; His attitude in Absalom&rsquo;s rebellion is all but imbecile.&nbsp;
No act is recorded of him to the day of his death but what is questionable,
if not mean and crafty.&nbsp; The one sudden flash of the old nobleness
which he has shewn in pardoning Shimei, he himself stultifies with his
dying lips by a mean command to Solomon to entrap and slay the man whom
he has too rashly forgiven.&nbsp; The whole matter of the sacrifice
of Saul&rsquo;s sons is so very strange, so puzzling, even shocking
to our ideas of right and wrong, that I cannot wonder at, though I dare
not endorse, Coleridge&rsquo;s bold assertion, that they were sacrificed
to a plot of State policy, and the suspicion of some critics, that the
whole scene was arranged between David and a too complaisant priesthood,
and God&rsquo;s name blasphemously taken in vain to find a pretext for
a political murder.&nbsp; And so David shivers pitiably to his grave,
after a fashion which has furnished a jest for cynics and infidels,
but which contains, to the eyes of a wise man, the elements of the deepest
tragedy; one more awful lesson that human beauty, valour, wit, genius,
success, glory, are vanity of vanities: that man is nothing, and God
is all in all.</p>
<p>But some may ask, What has all this to do with us?&nbsp; To do with
us?&nbsp; Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, &lsquo;All these
things are written for our example&rsquo;?&nbsp; As long as human nature
is what it is now, and was three thousand years ago, so long shall we
be tempted to commit the same sins as David: different in outward form,
according to the conditions of society; but the same in spirit, the
same in sinfulness, and the same in the sure punishment which they bring.&nbsp;
And above all, will men to the end be tempted to the sin of self-indulgence,
want of self-control.&nbsp; In many ways, but surely in some way or
other, will every man&rsquo;s temptation be, to lose self-control.</p>
<p>Therefore settle it in your minds, young men, that the first and
the last of all virtues and graces of which God can give is self-control;
as necessary for the saint and the sage, lest they become fanatics or
pedants, as for the young man in the hey-day of youth and health; but
as necessary for the young man as for the saint and the sage, lest,
while they become only fanatics and pedants, he become a profligate,
and a cumberer of the ground.</p>
<p>Remember this&mdash;remember it now in the glorious days of youth
which never will return, but in which you are sowing seed of which you
will reap the fruit until your dying day.&nbsp; Know that as you sow,
so will you reap.&nbsp; If you sow to the flesh, you will of the flesh
reap corruption; corruption&mdash;deterioration, whether of health,
of intellect, of character in some shape or other.&nbsp; You know not,
and no man knows, what the curse will be like; but the curse will surely
come.&nbsp; The thing which is done cannot be undone; and you will find
that out before, and not merely after your dying day.&nbsp; Therefore
rejoice in your youth, for God has given it to you; but remember, that
for it, as for each and all of his gifts, God will bring you into judgment.&nbsp;
And when the hour of temptation comes, go back&mdash;go back, if you
would escape&mdash;to what you all were taught at your mother&rsquo;s
knee concerning the grace of God; for that alone will keep you safe,
or angel, or archangel, or any created being safe, in this life and
in all lives to come.</p>

<h2>SERMON V.&nbsp; FRIENDSHIP; OR, DAVID AND JONATHAN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>2 Samuel i.&nbsp; 26.&nbsp; I am distressed for thee, my brother
Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful,
passing the love of women.</p>
<p>Passing the love of woman!&nbsp; That is a hard saying.&nbsp; What
love can pass that?&nbsp; Yet David doubtless spoke truth.&nbsp; He
was a man who must have had reason enough to know what woman&rsquo;s
love was like; and when he said that the love of Jonathan for him passed
even that, he bestowed on his friend praise which will be immortal.</p>
<p>The name of Jonathan will remain for ever as the perfect pattern
of friendship.</p>
<p>Let us think a little to-day over his noble character and his tragical
history.&nbsp; It will surely do us good.&nbsp; If it does nothing but
make us somewhat ashamed of ourselves, that is almost the best thing
which can happen to us or to any man.</p>
<p>We first hear of Jonathan as doing a very gallant deed.&nbsp; We
might expect as much.&nbsp; It is only great-hearted men who can be
true friends; mean and cowardly men can never know what friendship means.</p>
<p>The Israelites were hidden in thickets, and caves, and pits, for
fear of the Philistines, when Jonathan was suddenly inspired to attack
a Philistine garrison, under circumstances seemingly desperate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer
made, was about twenty men, within, as it were, an half-acre of land,
which a yoke of oxen might plough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is one of those little hints which shews that the story is true,
written by a man who knew the place&mdash;who had probably been in the
great battle of Beth-aven, which followed, and had perhaps ascended
the rock where Jonathan had done his valiant deed, and had seen the
dead bodies lying as they had fallen before him and his armour-bearer.</p>
<p>Then follows the story of David&rsquo;s killing Goliath, and coming
back to Saul with the giant&rsquo;s head in his hand, and answering
modestly to him, &lsquo;I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved
him as his own soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his
bow, and to his girdle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He loved him as his own soul.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because his soul
was like the soul of David; because he was modest, he loved David&rsquo;s
modesty; because he was brave, he loved David&rsquo;s courage; because
he was virtuous, he loved David&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; He saw that David
was all that he was himself, and more; and therefore he loved him as
his own soul.&nbsp; And therefore I said, that it is only noble and
great hearts who can have great friendships; who admire and delight
in other men&rsquo;s goodness; who, when they see a great and godlike
man, conceive, like Jonathan, such an affection for him that they forget
themselves, and think only of him, till they will do anything for him,
sacrifice anything for him, as Jonathan did for David.</p>
<p>For remember, that Jonathan had cause to hate and envy David rather
than love him; and that he would have hated him if there had been any
touch of meanness or selfishness in his heart.&nbsp; Gradually he learnt,
as all Israel learnt, that Samuel had anointed David to be king, and
that he, Jonathan, was in danger of not succeeding after Saul&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; David stood between him and the kingdom.&nbsp; And yet
he did not envy David&mdash;did not join his father for a moment in
plotting his ruin.&nbsp; He would oppose his father, secretly indeed,
and respectfully; but still, he would be true to David, though he had
to bear insults and threats of death.</p>
<p>And mark here one element in Jonathan&rsquo;s great friendship.&nbsp;
Jonathan is a pious man, as well as a righteous one.&nbsp; He believes
the Lord&rsquo;s messages that he has chosen David to be king, and he
submits; seeing that it is just and right, and that David is worthy
of the honour, though it be to the hurt of himself and of his children
after him.&nbsp; It is the Lord&rsquo;s will; and he, instead of repining
against it, must carry it out as far as he is concerned.&nbsp; Yes;
those who are most true to their fellow-men are always those who are
true to God; for the same spirit of God which makes them fear God makes
them also love their neighbour.</p>
<p>When David escapes from Saul to Samuel, it is Jonathan who does all
he can to save him.&nbsp; The two friends meet secretly in the field.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I
have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, or the third day, and,
behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,
and shew it thee; the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then David and Jonathan agree upon a sign between them, by which
David may know Saul&rsquo;s humour without his bow-bearer finding out
David.&nbsp; He will shoot three arrows toward the place where David
is in hiding; and if he says to his bow-bearer, The arrows are on this
side of thee, David is to come; for he is safe.&nbsp; But if he says,
The arrows are beyond thee, David must flee for his life, for the Lord
has sent him away.</p>
<p>Then Jonathan goes in to meat with his father Saul, and excuses David
for being absent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Saul&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and
he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse, rebellious woman, do not
I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion,
and unto the confusion of thy mother?&nbsp; For as long as the son of
Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
kingdom.&nbsp; Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall
surely die.&nbsp; And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto
him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?&nbsp; And Saul
cast a javelin at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was
determined of his father to slay David.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He goes to the field and shoots the arrows, and gives the sign agreed
on.&nbsp; He sends his bow-bearer back to the city, and David comes
out of his hiding-place in the rock Ezel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself
three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another,
until David exceeded.&nbsp; And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace,
forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying,
The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
ever.&nbsp; And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so the two friends parted, and saw one another, it seems, but
once again, when Jonathan went to David in the forest of Ziph, and &lsquo;strengthened
his hand in God,&rsquo; with noble words.</p>
<p>After that, Jonathan vanishes from the story of David.&nbsp; We hear
only of him that he died fighting by his father&rsquo;s side, upon the
downs of Gilboa.&nbsp; The green plot at their top, where the Israelites&rsquo;
last struggle was probably made, can be seen to this day; and there
most likely Jonathan fell, and over him David raised his famous lamentation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.&nbsp; I
am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou
been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.&nbsp;
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So ends the beautiful and tragical story of a truly gallant man.&nbsp;
Seldom, indeed, will there be seen in the world such perfect friendship
between man and man, as that between Jonathan and David.&nbsp; Seldom,
indeed, shall we see anyone loving and adoring the very man whom his
selfish interest would teach him to hate and to supplant.&nbsp; But
still every man may have, and ought to have a friend.&nbsp; Wretched
indeed, and probably deservedly wretched, is the man who has none.&nbsp;
And every man may learn from this story of Jonathan how to choose his
friends.</p>
<p>I say, to choose.&nbsp; No one is bound to be at the mercy of anybody
and everybody with whom he may come in contact.&nbsp; No one is bound
to say, That man lives next door to me, therefore he must be my friend.&nbsp;
We are bound not to avoid our neighbours.&nbsp; They are put near us
by God in his providence.&nbsp; God intends every one of them, good
or bad, to help in educating us, in giving us experience of life and
manners.&nbsp; We are to learn from them, live with them in peace and
charity, and only avoid them when we find that their company is really
doing us harm, and leading us into sin and folly.&nbsp; But a friend&mdash;which
is a much deeper and more sacred word than neighbour&mdash;a friend
we have the right and the power to choose; and our wisest plan will
be to copy Jonathan, and choose our friends, not for their usefulness,
but for their goodness; not for their worth to us, but for their worth
in themselves; and to choose, if possible, people superior to ourselves.&nbsp;
If we meet a man better than ourselves, more wise than ourselves, more
learned, more experienced, more delicate-minded, more high-minded, let
us take pains to win his esteem, to gain his confidence, and to win
him as a friend, for the sake of his worth.</p>
<p>Then in our friendship, as in everything else in the world, we shall
find the great law come true, that he that loseth his life shall save
it.&nbsp; He who does not think of himself and his own interest will
be the very man who will really help himself, and further his own interest
the most.&nbsp; For the friend whom we have chosen for his own worth,
will be the one who will be worth most to us.&nbsp; The friend whom
we have loved and admired for his own sake, will be the one who will
do most to raise our character, to teach us, to refine us, to help us
in time of doubt and trouble.&nbsp; The higher-minded man our friend
is, the higher-minded will he make us.&nbsp; For it is written, &lsquo;As
iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the face of his friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing can be more foolish, or more lowering to our own character,
than to choose our friends among those who can only flatter us, and
run after us, who look up to us as oracles, and fetch and carry at our
bidding, while they do our souls and characters no good, but merely
feed our self-conceit, and lower us down to their own level.&nbsp; But
it is wise, and ennobling to our own character, to choose our friends
among those who are nearer to God than we are, more experienced in life,
and more strong and settled in character.&nbsp; Wise it is to have a
friend of whom we are at first somewhat afraid; before whom we dare
not say or do a foolish thing, whose just anger or contempt would be
to us a thing terrible.&nbsp; Better it is that friendship should begin
with a little wholesome fear, till time and mutual experience of each
other&rsquo;s characters shall have brought about the perfect love which
casts out fear.&nbsp; Better to say with David, &lsquo;He that telleth
lies shall not stay in my sight; I will not know a wicked person.&nbsp;
Yea, let the righteous rather smite me friendly and reprove me.&nbsp;
All my delight is in the saints that are in the earth, and in such as
excel in virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And let no man fancy that by so doing he lowers himself, and puts
himself in a mean place.&nbsp; There is no man so strong-minded but
what he may find a stronger-minded man than himself to give him counsel;
no man is so noble-hearted but what he may find a nobler-hearted man
than himself to keep him up to what is true and just and honourable,
when he is tempted to play the coward, and be false to God&rsquo;s Spirit
within him.&nbsp; No man is so pure-minded but what he may find a purer-minded
person than himself to help him in the battle against the world, the
flesh, and the devil.</p>
<p>My friends, do not think it a mean thing to look up to those who
are superior to yourselves.&nbsp; On the contrary, you will find in
practice that it is only the meanest hearts, the shallowest and the
basest, who feel no admiration, but only envy for those who are better
than themselves; who delight in finding fault with them, and blackening
their character, and showing that they are not, after all, so much superior
to other people; while it is the noblest-hearted, the very men who are
most worthy to be admired themselves, who, like Jonathan, feel most
the pleasure, the joy, and the strength of reverence; of having some
one whom they can look up to and admire; some one in whose company they
can forget themselves, their own interest, their own pleasure, their
own honour and glory, and cry, Him I must hear; him I must follow; to
him I must cling, whatever may betide.&nbsp; Blessed and ennobling is
the feeling which gathers round a wise teacher or a great statesman
all the most earnest, high-minded, and pious youths of his generation;
the feeling which makes soldiers follow the general whom they trust,
they know not why or whither, through danger, and hunger, and fatigue,
and death itself; the feeling which, in its highest perfection, made
the Apostles forsake all and follow Christ, saying, &lsquo;Lord, to
whom shall we go?&nbsp; Thou hast the words of eternal life&rsquo;&mdash;which
made them ready to work and to die for him whom the world called the
son of the carpenter, but whom they, through the Spirit of God bearing
witness with their own pure and noble spirits, knew to be the Son of
the Living God.</p>
<p>Ay, a blessed thing it is for any man or woman to have a friend;
one human soul whom we can trust utterly; who knows the best and the
worst of us, and who loves us, in spite of all our faults; who will
speak the honest truth to us, while the world flatters us to our face,
and laughs at us behind our back; who will give us counsel and reproof
in the day of prosperity and self-conceit; but who, again, will comfort
and encourage us in the day of difficulty and sorrow, when the world
leaves us alone to fight our own battle as we can.</p>
<p>If we have had the good fortune to win such a friend, let us do anything
rather than lose him.&nbsp; We must give and forgive; live and let live.&nbsp;
If our friend have faults, we must bear with them.&nbsp; We must hope
all things, believe all things, endure all things, rather than lose
that most precious of all earthly possessions&mdash;a trusty friend.</p>
<p>And a friend, once won, need never be lost, if we will only be trusty
and true ourselves.&nbsp; Friends may part&mdash;not merely in body,
but in spirit, for a while.&nbsp; In the bustle of business and the
accidents of life they may lose sight of each other for years; and more&mdash;they
may begin to differ in their success in life, in their opinions, in
their habits, and there may be, for a time, coldness and estrangement
between them; but not for ever, if each will be but trusty and true.</p>
<p>For then, according to the beautiful figure of the poet, they will
be like two ships who set sail at morning from the same port, and ere
nightfall lose sight of each other, and go each on its own course, and
at its own pace, for many days, through many storms and seas; and yet
meet again, and find themselves lying side by side in the same haven,
when their long voyage is past.</p>
<p>And if not, my friends; if they never meet; if one shall founder
and sink upon the seas, or even change his course, and fly shamefully
home again: still, is there not a Friend of friends who cannot change,
but is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?</p>
<p>What says the noble hymn:&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;When gathering clouds around I view,<br />And days are dark
and friends are few,<br />On him I lean, who, not in vain,<br />Experienced
every human pain:<br />He sees my griefs, allays my fears,<br />And
counts and treasures up my tears.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Passing the love of woman was his love, indeed; and of him Jonathan
was but such a type, as the light in the dewdrop is the type of the
sun in heaven.</p>
<p>He himself said&mdash;and what he said, that he fulfilled&mdash;&lsquo;Greater
love hath no man than this&mdash;that a man lay down his life for his
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In treachery and desertion; in widowhood and childlessness; in the
hour of death, and in the day of judgment, when each soul must stand
alone before its God, one Friend remains, and that the best of all.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
